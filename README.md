Project: Real Estate Price Prediction Website
Built and deployed a data science web application to predict house prices in Bangalore, India. Leveraged a 10,000+ home dataset from Kaggle to train a machine learning model (scikit-learn, linear regression) for accurate price estimations. Developed a user-friendly interface (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) allowing users to input property details and receive predictions through a Python Flask server.

Utilized diverse data science techniques including data loading & cleaning, outlier handling, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV), and k-fold cross-validation for model robustness.

Tools & Technologies: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Flask, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
